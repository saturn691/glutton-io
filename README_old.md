# Client-Server Interface

## Websockets in Javascript

Websockets were implemented on both client and server side in Javascript.

To run the program, you would first need to download `Node.js` on your machine. 

### In server folder:

Run:

```sudo npm i socket.io```

```sudo npm i @socket.io/admin-ui```

```npm run devStart```

Saving changes to the `.js` automatically refreshes the instance.

### In the client folder:

Run:

```sudo npm i socket.io```

```npm start```

Saving changes to the `.js` automatically too!

*ADVICE*: Download the `LiveServer` extension on VSCode
